Coming back after vacation I had an urge to:
1) know how old my step cat is in cat years
2) take Scheme for a test drive

So here we are :)

To run/compile this you need [CHICKEN Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org).

Then

$ csi -s cat-age-calculator.scm 10

Your cat's age is equivalent to 56 human years old.

Wow, that furry bundle of joy is a quite old chap!
